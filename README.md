This project was developed with react, and thus does not reflect the intented technologies to be implemented. To understand why, please read the following:

## Goals

In the project we intended to use Flutter/Dart to create a cross-platform app that utilizes various IBM Cloud functionalities. Specifically, our aim was to design an API based on our app idea using IBM API Connect, then minimize all necessary API/database calls by wrapping it in GraphQL. 

## Challenges
We faced a lot of issues learning the new platforms, frameworks and languages for the first time, but we faced even more issues trying to mesh the technologies based on our current understanding.

## Work arounds
Recognizing that we hit similar obstacles at each attempt of implementation, we made efforts to reach out for help to mentors and tutorials. Unfortunately, we still faced significant difficulties. Thus, we changed our focus from implementation to a scan of feasibility, with a heavy focus on theory, while considering our intentions. 

## Final decisions
The code within this repository is simply a last-ditch effort to provide an example to how our project would look & operate (on a small scale).

Thank you, for taking the time to check out our work!
